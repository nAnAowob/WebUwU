      <!-- ABOUT ME -->
      <section aria-labelledby="About Me" id="info">
        <h2 id="aboutme">Who is</h2>
        <h2 class="ann">Chompunick?</h2>
        <h4>> My name is Chompunick Chieng, or you can call me AnnAnn.</h4>
        <h3>My Interest</h3>
        <h4>Guitar</h4>
        <p>
          My passion for guitar started when I found a Japanese guitarist called
          “せ” (se) on YouTube. His guitar skills and tone have sparked my
          interest in guitar and music.
        </p>
        <h4>Art</h4>
        <p>
          I've started practicing drawing by myself since middle school during
          the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though I mainly do digital arts, skills
          from frequent practice and knowing colour theory, hand pressure, and
          composition makes me available to do UX/UI design, water colour, and
          monochrome arts.
        </p>
        <h4>Astronomy</h4>
        <p>
          I started attending the Astronomy Olympiad from I was in grade 8th
          until grade 11th. At first, I was not interested in anything about the
          Earth, stars, or constellations, but the more I studied about them,
          the more I was into them. However, it is too late to realise how much
          I am passionate about Astronomy. I could not get into the national
          round in last year's pre-national round. Therefore, I would like to
          start my new journey in computational astrophysics at university.
        </p>
        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p>
          When I was in elementary school, I was always the first or only one
          who finished the fast-typing assignment. My childhood pride motivated
          my interest in programming until now. So I have started learning some
          programming languages such as C, C++, CSS, Python, and HTML

      <h5>
        Contributed to research: The Study on Solar System’s Asteroid
        Distribution Correlation with Fluid Instability Principle
      </h5>
      <p>
        This research aims to study the correlation between solar system
        asteroid distribution in the Trojan and Hilda categories and the fluid
        instability principle. My senior, Mr.Pavarit Phanichkul, a KVIS student
        from batch 6, announced to find a junior that interested in astronomy
        and programming to find the equation of asteroid distribution and do a
        3D scatter plot in Python, then compare the results with another
        simulation from my senior.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Research: AstroDS U-NET/GAN: Revisiting U-NET for Astronomical Image
        Denoising Based on SSIM Loss and GAN
      </h5>
      <p>
        Traditional astronomical image denoising methods can lead to missing
        information such as loss information of noise, or maybe some unwanted
        signal still present. There are many kinds of noise and they are random,
        so traditional denoising methods struggle to remove them out. This is
        why we need to make a new method to denoise that can overcome those
        problems.
        <br />
        Artificial intelligence has a remarkable adaptability to different types
        of noises, and its efficiency and accuracy can be presented as the value
        of different functions. So we need to simulate noise into the denoised
        image to ensure that the performance of our model can denoise as well as
        the original image

      <h3>Awards</h3>
      <h4>Science</h4>
      <h5>Astronomy POSN 2020-2023</h5>
      <p>
        Get into a pre-national round of the Astronomy Olympiad of Chulalongkorn
        University from 2022-2021 and Mahidol Wittayanusorn School from
        2022-2023 Note: POSN = The Promotion of Academic Olympiad and
        Development of Science Education Foundation under the patronage of Her
        Royal Highness Princess Galyani Vadhana Krom Luang Naradhiwas
        Rajanagarindra (สอวน.)
      </p>
      <h5>IYPT 2024</h5>
      <p>
        Participated in national round (International Young Physicist Tournament
        2024)
      </p>
      <h5>CUD Hackathon 2023 Finalist</h5>
      <p>CUD Hackathon: Good Health and Well Being Innovation finalist</p>
      <h5>Rocket Special Award: CANSAT-ROCKET Thailand Competition 2023</h5>
      <p>
        The CANSAT ROCKET Competition is a contest where teams create a small
        satellite called a CANSAT and launch it into the sky using a rocket. The
        satellite, about the size of a soda can, is packed with sensors and
        tools to do specific tasks like collecting data or running experiments.
        Teams compete to see whose satellite can do its job well and send back
        information to Earth. It's a fun and educational event that mixes
        engineering, physics, and aerospace. We teamed with 5 people and
        separated into Rocket team and CANSAT team. I was in rocket team, doing
        open-rocket simulation, checking the rocket stability, and analyse the
        data after it launched to know the speed and distance of the rocket.
        Despite the CANSAT that the microcontroller sensors accidentally crush
        just before launched time, our rocket reached the highest altitude among
        other 15 finalists.
      </p>
      <h5>Honor Award: CANSAT-ROCKET Thailand Competition 2024</h5>
      <p>
        After the problem we faced in the previous year, we developed our CANSAT
        and ROCKET model, and use solidworks to depict the model of our CANSAT.
        Unfortunately, we could get only an honor award and could not get into
        final round.
